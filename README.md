# Eigenvalue Ratios and Generalization in LLMs

This project investigates the relationship between eigenvalue ratios and model generalization in Large Language Models, particularly focusing on the claims about the connection between stable rank and generalization behavior.

```

## Usage

Details on running experiments coming soon.

## Experiments

This repository contains code for two main experimental tracks:

1. Correlation Analysis: Track eigenvalue ratios during natural training
2. Controlled Intervention: Artificially modify eigenvalue ratios
